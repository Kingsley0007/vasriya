  <h1>About Vasriya</h1>

  <h2>Our Brand Story</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence is transforming how the world works. But for many people, AI still feels complicated, overwhelming, or out of reach.</p>
  <p>Every day, thousands of powerful AI tools are released — tools that can write, design, automate work, build software, analyze data, and even run businesses. Yet most people never discover them, and even fewer know how to use them effectively.</p>
  <p>Vasriya was created to bridge that gap.</p>
  <p>Our goal is simple: <strong>make AI understandable, accessible, and practical for everyone.</strong></p>
  <p>Instead of treating AI as something only experts can use, we believe it should become a <strong>daily productivity partner</strong> for anyone — students, professionals, creators, entrepreneurs, and businesses.</p>
  <p>Through curated resources, guides, tool recommendations, and real-world use cases, Vasriya helps people discover the right AI tools and learn how to apply them meaningfully.</p>
  <p>Because the future will belong to people who <strong>know how to work with AI — not compete against it.</strong></p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Our mission is to <strong>educate and empower people to use AI tools effectively in their everyday work and creativity.</strong></p>
  <p>We aim to simplify the rapidly growing AI ecosystem and help individuals and organizations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discover the best AI tools available</li>
    <li>Understand how those tools work</li>
    <li>Learn practical workflows and real-world use cases</li>
    <li>Increase productivity through automation</li>
    <li>Build smarter digital systems</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By turning complex technology into clear, actionable knowledge, we help people unlock the real power of artificial intelligence.</p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>We envision a world where <strong>AI literacy becomes as common as digital literacy.</strong></p>
  <p>In the future, every professional — regardless of their field — will use AI as part of their daily workflow.</p>
  <p>Our vision is to build a platform that becomes a <strong>trusted global hub for AI knowledge and tools</strong>, helping:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beginners take their first steps with AI</li>
    <li>Creators amplify their creativity</li>
    <li>Developers accelerate innovation</li>
    <li>Businesses build smarter systems</li>
    <li>Teams automate repetitive work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By guiding people through this transformation, we help shape a future where technology <strong>amplifies human potential instead of replacing it.</strong></p>

  <h2>Founder Story</h2>
  <p>Vasriya was founded by an engineer who believes that technology should simplify work, not complicate it.</p>
  <p>Coming from a background in <strong>software engineering, automation, and system design</strong>, the founder spent years building tools, debugging complex systems, and improving development workflows. During this journey, one realization became clear:</p>
  <p>The biggest barrier to powerful technology is not the technology itself — it is <strong>access and understanding</strong>.</p>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence is one of the most powerful technological shifts in history. Yet many people struggle to keep up with the speed at which new tools and capabilities are emerging.</p>
  <p>Vasriya was created to solve this problem: to organize the chaos of AI innovation into something people can <strong>learn, trust, and use every day.</strong></p>
  <p>The mission is not just to showcase AI tools — but to <strong>teach people how to think with AI.</strong></p>

  <h2>About the Founder</h2>
  <p>The founder of Vasriya is a software engineer passionate about building systems that make complex technology easier to understand and use.</p>
  <p>With experience in <strong>web automation, developer tools, and large-scale software workflows</strong>, the founder focuses on creating platforms that combine technology, learning, and practical problem solving.</p>
  <p>Driven by curiosity and a strong belief in ethical technology, the goal is to help people adapt to the rapidly evolving AI landscape and use it to build, create, and innovate.</p>
